# surveykit

A lightweight, in-app micro-survey and announcement engine for Next.js apps.

SurveyKit lets you show surveys, announcements, and feedback prompts inside your app using simple JSON configuration. All targeting is evaluated client-side, and you decide where responses are stored.

No hosted backend. No vendor lock-in.

## Why SurveyKit?

Most in-app survey tools are tied to hosted platforms and expensive add-ons.
SurveyKit is different:

- Surveys are defined as plain JSON
- Targeting runs entirely in the browser
- Responses are sent to your own API
- You keep full control of data and branding

SurveyKit is designed to be simple to integrate and easy to remove.
